# Cloud Resume Challenge 2024

I'm Andrea, a junior cloud developer currently undertaking The Cloud Resume Challenge (AWS Edition) by Forrest Brazeal.

This project is designed to showcase essential skills for a successful career in cloud engineering. As I progress through each stage, I will add its accompanying readme and respective files to this repo. For a more in-depth description of my thought process, documentation, and updates, I invite you to follow my Medium page.
